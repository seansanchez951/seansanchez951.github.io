Reviewing Pitchfork Reviews

Analysis of Pitchfork music reviews through data visualization

Music has been a passion throughout my entire life. Iâ€™ve spent countless hours listening to and collecting music both in digital and physical formats. The online music publication Pitchfork has been vital in my personal search to find new and exciting music. The website is best known for its daily output of music reviews. Their catalog has grown immensely over the past 20 years of digital publication. My goal is to analyze their extensive catalog of reviews to come up with some unique insights and tell a story about the history of Pitchfork music reviews.
